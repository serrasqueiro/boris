Introduction
+++
Unlike 'gfastauth', cysoft lib was built from scratch; idea is to provide
simple mechanisms for authentication.


Debug
+++
Some hints:
	% debug "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" | g Hash\(
	-1052688030     Hash('The ...')
The hash of a string is a 32bit value (long).
For other pangrams, refer to [1].

Debug without any arg will assume 4 args:
	Abc EMPTY NULL Done

Debug with
	HASH [file]
will dump string hashes for file lines (or stdin if no arg is given).
Useful for using against 'dictionaries', e.g.
	./debug HASH /usr/share/dict/linux.words
This allows assessing whether hash against common words is mostly different.
