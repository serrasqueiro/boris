libiobjs

Intro
+++++
This lib is based on libgobj 1.0; original libgobj contained lots of built-in
primitives to control:
	* opened files and sockets;
	* signal handling;
	* lists, strings;
	* Unicode dynamic tables.
But had a limited handling of lists (e.g.: insertion of elements in a list),
etc. Extended libs, such as libgobjeio, implemented this in inherited classes.
The idea of libiobjs is to:
	* i - implement gobjs in an efficient and 'sImple' way;
	* s - full/extended support of lists and strings,
	* although without the extra embedded facilities provided by gobj or
	  their expanded libs.


Version
+++++
Current version:
	v3.1

v3.x has Hash support.
v2.1 has GetInt for gTop, and few minor fixes.


How-to compile
+++++
Just issue make. This lib does not depend on any lib, other than the
standard supporting (shared-)lib for C++: the libstdc++.

Special '-Dxxx' defines can be issued using:
	make CC_BASIC='-Dxxx1 -Dxxx2 ...'
One of the well-known defines is:
	* iDOS_SPEC, indicating a Windows environment, compatible to Dev-C++;
	* or FREESCO: that supports older Kernels, such as 2.0.3x...
