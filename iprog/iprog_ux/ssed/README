ssed - a small sed

* Base64 conversions
* Base65 conversions (similar to Base64, but with '%' instead of '/')
* UTF-8 conversions
* URL name-builder
* Line histogram

It uses imedia library for converting UTF-8 into UCS2, and makes use of
iobjs library for Base64 and Base65 ('gString64').

Hint:
	gStringBase::base64[ 128 ]=
	"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/";


Hint-too: about URL builders
	The URL name-builder:
		- non name standard characters are cut
			? + =
		- special characters are converted into %02X (Hex)
			& :
		  (or in fact any character above 126d)
		- blanks are transformed into '+'

		Additionally separation characters like
			colons (and semi-colons)
		can be cut.

Line histogram:
- Generates an histogram for each text line;
  different lines have (most likely) different string-hash;
  this command tells how many lines are X, Y, ...Z.

  Although string-hash method described above would be faster,
  only basic list-string compare is implemented.
