ilibs  (c) 2010, 2021  Henrique Moreira

Part of iprog/ repository. ilibs/ has multiple libs:

	cysoft
	icntp
	ilambda
	ilog
	imaudio
	imedia
	iobjs
	ipopclient

The most important is iobjs, which gathers a 'refreshed' gobj library:
	- it is more simplified (e.g. no built-in UniCode lib),
	- it has more methods (like string hashing),
	- it contains several fixes.

gobj was born and published by me at SourceForge [1]
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/libunicode-plus/
under xpfweb-v2.8.1 (c) 2008
The great advantage of xpfweb is that is provenly tested for Linux and Windows
platforms. ilibs/iobjs is derived from that work, and has been tested in Linux
and Windows just as well.

ilambda has several add-ons for TCP connectivity, like 'bind one/two
interfaces', sockets, and hashing.

imedia library has a really fast Web parser (take a look at isweb.cpp,h);
although it does not have gUnweb full capabilities, it is faster by far
(note: incomplete!)


Development details
+++
All libs can be generated to standard '.a' libs or '.so', makefiles are only
covering shared libraries currently.
Compilation has been checked against gcc/g++ (GNU C++ compiler), and DevCpp
(Bloodshed Software, which now became orwelldevcpp - a simple front-end for
MinGW, at www.mingw.org).
Everything is compatible with gcc 2.96, and Kernel dependencies has been kept
to a minimum.

Before 2015 this set of libraries used the following compiler switches:
	-Wno-deprecated -Wno-write-strings
but from this time onwards, both -Wall, -Werror, and:
	-Wdeprecated -Wwrite-strings
(which is there to force older gcc versions, like gcc 2.96, to look for invalid
'non (const char*)' types.
