xmeasure
++++++++++
xmeasures is the protocol for exchanging information between several networks
points. Remote network points are named remote clients, usually using a
permanent TCP connection to the 'iserver' [1]. First remote connection is
authenticated (HskAuth), remaining information exchange uses no or fast
simetric encryption.

The main purpose of xmeasure is two fold:
    - measure connectivity between two or more distinct locations,
    - measure TCP/network latency in the network.

A single server (iserver) collects information about remote sites. The role can
be inverted in a simple way: one or more remote clients monitor the reliability
of their connection to iserver.


Example 1 - HTTP internet server monitoring
++++++++++
Let us consider a simple example: one internet HTTP server is at Lisbon, serves
mainly IP address space from Portugal. The service provider isn't that
reliable, so, the Company Xyz needs to assess its connectivity (uptime, general
connectivity.) It can use several remote network points to connect permanently
to this server. Alternatively, one would have to trigger "http gets" in a
cronjob fashion.
