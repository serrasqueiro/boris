This is an useful to dump your files into some dir before going to a CD or
DVD. It is mainly designed for audio on CD although any other destination
format will do too.

The following interesting commands:
	- crosslink, to create a series of soft-links to another path,
	- copy, pretty much the same but it actually copies contents.

Other commands are available:
	- test, just a plain test
	- vpl-dump, to dump a vpl file
	- ren, being done
	- compact, to nail down a directory (or suggest, using -z 1)
	- generated, example:
		juicebox generated \
			-b H:\\huge\\images\\music\\ \
			-l /mnt/tmp/a.log -z 256 \
			~/tmp/images/list_musco.txu > a.m3u


Environment variables
+++
The following environment variables allow a change of the default behavior.
	"DIGITS_FORMAT"
		-> %03d is the default prefix, three digits with a leading zero;
		   a dot means no prefix digits.
	"HOME",
		-> guess configuration file (Linux OS)
	"USERPROFILE"
	"HOMEDRIVE"
		-> "C:", or any other drive (if "USERPROFILE" is not there)
	"JUICEBOX_DUMP"
		-> output file
	"SUBST"
		-> Skip read out of config file
	"TEMP", "TMP"
		-> Other temporary directory for /tmp/.juicebox (Linux OS)
		   or juicebox.tmp (Windows).


Examples
+++

Win32, generating a random playlist:
	C:\Documents and Settings\henrique\My Documents\My Music>juicebox generated -d 4 -b H:\images\music\ H:\images\list_musco.txu -o a.m3u


The command 'generate' uses a different approach: you can use existing
playlists to dump every song (use '-f' to dump only if file exists.)
The following playlists can be read:
	- .m3u (general text listing)
	- .vpl
	- .pls (old playlist style)
	- .xspf (VLC style)
	- .wpl (Windows playlist, i.e. from Mediaplayer)
Output starts with #EXTM3U
Limiting output size is done using '-z'.
By default (without '-a' option) no duplicates are dumped.
Analysis is made on similarities of names, but this whole work is not complete.
